##DESCRIPTION

*Endless Reach HD* is an evolution of one of the first games made by Soverance Studios.  The original *Endless Reach* was released on Android in July, 2014 ([Free on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Soverance.EndlessReach)), and was a simple yet challenging shoot 'em up.  *Endless Reach HD* aims to be a completely new vision, taking some of the themes from the first *ER* and reimagining them as an action-packed dual-stick shooter where you explore new galaxies, take on new bounties, battle various starships, and escape from the law as you work to become the greatest smuggler in the universe.
