## DESCRIPTION

*Endless Reach HD* is an action-packed dual-stick shooter where you explore new galaxies, take on new bounties, battle various starships, and escape from the law as you work to become the greatest smuggler in the universe.  

*Endless Reach HD* is an evolution of one of the first games made by Soverance Studios.  The original *Endless Reach* was released on Android in July, 2014 ([Free on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Soverance.EndlessReach)), and was a simple yet challenging shoot 'em up.  *Endless Reach HD* aims to be a completely new vision, using the world and themes established with the first *ER* and reimagining them into a high-powered action experience, powered by Unreal Engine 4.

## Disclaimer

This module is provided as is, and is not intended to be a complete, working game. Instead, this module is meant to be used as a learning resource for others looking to bring their UE4 games to C++.

While I'd love to completely open-source *Endless Reach HD*, significant portions of the code used to create the full game is currently within UE4's Blueprint system, and of course I do not have the rights to redistribute any of the assets I've used to create the game. So this repository is the best I can do, providing you with the direct source I've used to build the game's foundation.

If you find something in the game that you'd like to add or change, this is the place to start. Feel free to ask me any questions you have about the code you find here, and be sure to make a pull request if you make any changes or fixes and I'll work to integrate it into the game. I'll add your name to the in-game credits in exchange for successful PRs!
